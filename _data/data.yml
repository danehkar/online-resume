    Ashkbiz "Ash" Danehkar is an astrophysicist employed at Eureka Scientific, where he receives funds from NASA. Prior to his current appointment, he held the position of research fellow at the University of Michigan and a postdoctoral position at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics from 2015 to 2021. In 2014, he earned his Ph.D. from Macquarie University with the support of a Macquarie Research Excellence Scholarship. Ash is mostly interested in theoretical, observational, and computational astrophysics. Specifically, he is interested in studying superwinds in star-forming galaxies, ultra-fast outflows in active galactic nuclei, astrophysics related to the interstellar medium, and the gravitational physics of supermassive black holes.
